# Node.js Code Review Guidelines

This document provides the checkpoints and instructions for reviewing the Node.js project. The AI should analyze the repository and generate a report in table format.

## Checkpoints

1. **Code Quality**
   - Check for clear, readable, and maintainable code.
   - Identify unused variables, functions, or imports.
   - Suggest improvements for better structure or modularity.

2. **Security**
   - Detect common security issues, such as injection vulnerabilities.
   - Check for proper handling of secrets and environment variables.
   - Identify unsafe dependencies or outdated packages.

3. **Performance**
   - Identify inefficient loops, redundant computations, or blocking operations.
   - Suggest improvements for faster execution or lower memory usage.

4. **Best Practices**
   - Ensure the project follows Node.js and JavaScript best practices.
   - Check for proper error handling and logging.
   - Validate use of async/await vs callbacks where applicable.

5. **Maintainability**
   - Assess code modularity and separation of concerns.
   - Suggest ways to improve test coverage and documentation.
   - Highlight potential future challenges in scaling or extending the code.

## Instructions for the Final Report

- The AI should generate the report as a table with the following columns:

| Checkpoint        | Status       | Findings / Suggestions          |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Code Quality      | Passed/Fail | List issues or improvements here |
| Security          | Passed/Fail | List issues or improvements here |
| Performance       | Passed/Fail | List issues or improvements here |
| Best Practices    | Passed/Fail | List issues or improvements here |
| Maintainability   | Passed/Fail | List issues or improvements here |
